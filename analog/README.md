# notes

- 2 20k resistors to divide battery voltage
- [RC filter](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/filter/filter_2.html)
- Should demonstrate op amp adders with LEDs

## Operational Amplifiers

- [Integrator](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/opamp/opamp_6.html)
- [Digital to analog and summer circuit](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/opamp/opamp_4.html)

## Todo

- [ ] Schematics
- [ ] Digital to analog conversions
- [ ] LM324N testing
  - [ ] Test simple addition
    - Power supply can just use arduino for now
    - (1k and 10k resistors used for $R_a$ and $R_b$, everything else used 1k)
- [ ] AD633 testing
- [ ] Scaling Izhikevich equations between 3 volt range
- [ ] Linking adders and multipliers together
- [ ] Reset circuit
